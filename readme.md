> **CONDITIONAL DENOISING MODEL AS A PHYSICAL SURROGATE MODEL**

---

This work introduces the Conditional Denoising Model (CDM), a generative surrogate model that overcomes the training difficulties of Physics-Consistent Neural Netwroks by implicitly learning the physical solution manifold. Experiments on a plasma physics benchmark (`data/data_3000_points.txt`) show our model is more data- and parameter-efficient than a baseline NN with a Projection method.
